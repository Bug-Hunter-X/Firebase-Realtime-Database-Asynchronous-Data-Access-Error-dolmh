# Firebase Realtime Database Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error when working with Firebase's Realtime Database: a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'val')` error occurring during asynchronous data retrieval.  Even with seemingly correct asynchronous handling, the error can persist if the data isn't available when the code attempts to access it. This example highlights the problem and provides a solution using promises and error handling.

## Problem

The core issue is accessing database data before it's fully loaded.  Simple checks for `null` or `undefined` may not be sufficient because the object might exist, but the property 'val' inside it is undefined, leading to this cryptic error.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling and potentially using `.then()` for promise-based asynchronous operations to ensure data retrieval completion before access.  The code includes detailed comments explaining the fix.
