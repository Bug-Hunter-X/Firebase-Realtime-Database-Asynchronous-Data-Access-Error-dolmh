The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'val')` error when accessing data asynchronously, particularly when the data hasn't loaded yet or the reference is incorrect. This can occur even if you're using `.once()` or similar methods that seem to handle asynchronous operations.  This is often missed in debugging because it might not immediately reveal the underlying problem with the data retrieval.
